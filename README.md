# MazeProject
Basic maze project with undefined scope

What it does :
  -generate a 10x15 maze with hexagonal cells
  -basic interaction with the cells. 
    -MouseHover, the cell turns grey
    -MouseClick, the cells turn light grey
    -MouseExit, the cell turn dark grey
    
 Plan and ideas for future improvement
  - Add a regenerate feature
  - Custumize the size of the maze
  - Add a starting point and an ending point
  - Add a "player" and move throught the maze
